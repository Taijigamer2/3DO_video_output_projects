# **3DO 240p Mode**

The 3DO is an interesting piece of hardware. Originally designed to output a standard definition video signal at 480i NTSC or 576i PAL. A while ago it was discovered that the 3DO could be modded to output its video signal in progressive mode at 240p NTSC or 288P PAL. For more detailed information on how the 3DO handles 240p check here https://3dodev.com/documentation/hardware/opera/240p_mode
This method was originally documented here https://www.retrorgb.com/3do240p.html (original thread here https://assemblergames.org/viewtopic.php?t=816) but some 3DO models had trouble booting in 240p so users had to switch back from 480i after booting the console. This guide hopes to gather all the information I have found through my research and illustrate how to correctly modify a 3DO console to produce 240p video output. It will also hopefully dispel some of the misconceptions around it.

Background
A while ago, before we had publicly available hardware docs on the different 3DO hardware, I decided to try and see if any other models besides 3DO containing the VP536 encoder could be switched into 240p mode. I discovered that the Panasonic FZ-1E (PAL) and FZ-1 released in Canada containing the Brooktree BT9103 encoder could also handle 240p. Upon further investigation I found that the 3DO VDP (CLIO) had a pin for controlling interlace/ progressive mode on the analogue video encoder.
